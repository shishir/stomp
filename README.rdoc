===Example Usage

    client = Stomp::Client.new("test", "user", "localhost", 61613)
    client.send("/queue/mine", "hello world!")
    client.subscribe("/queue/mine") do |msg|
      p msg
    end

===Failover + SSL Example URL Usage

    options = "initialReconnectDelay=5000&randomize=false&useExponentialBackOff=false"
    
    # remotehost1 uses SSL, remotehost2 doesn't
    client = Stomp::Client.new("failover:(stomp+ssl://login1:passcode1@remotehost1:61612,stomp://login2:passcode2@remotehost2:61613)?#{options}")
    
    client.publish("/queue/mine", "hello world!")
    client.subscribe("/queue/mine") do |msg|
      p msg
    end

===Hash Login Example Usage

  hash = {
      :hosts => [
        {:login => "login1", :passcode => "passcode1", :host => "remotehost1", :port => 61612, :ssl => true},
        {:login => "login2", :passcode => "passcode2", :host => "remotehost2", :port => 61613, :ssl => false},
        
      ],
      # These are the default parameters, don't need to be set
      :initial_reconnect_delay => 0.01,
      :max_reconnect_delay => 30.0,
      :use_exponential_back_off => true,
      :back_off_multiplier => 2,
      :max_reconnect_attempts => 0,
      :randomize => false,
      :backup => false,
      :timeout => -1,
      :connect_headers => {},
      :parse_timeout => 5,
      :logger => nil,
    }
    
    # for client
    client = Stomp::Client.new(hash)
    
    # for connection
    connection = Stomp::Connection.new(hash)
